== Spring-Boot, Camel and AMQ QuickStart

This quickstart demonstrates how to connect a Spring-Boot application AMQ Broker and use JMS messaging between two Camel routes using Kubernetes or OpenShift.

In this example we will use two containers, one container to run as an AMQ Broker instance, and another as a client to the broker, where the Camel routes are running.

This quickstart requires AMQ Broker to have been deployed and running first. To install AMQ Broker into OpenShift or Kubernetes follow https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/2020.q4/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/assembly-br-planning-a-deployment_broker-ocp[documentation].

Quickstart uses the _standard address space_ and  requires standard authentication. For address space and queue definition _standard-small-queue_, _standard_unlimited_ plans are used, therefore make sure you have also installed example plans, roles and standard authentication service.

The application utilizes the Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html[`@ImportResource`] annotation to load a Camel Context definition via a _src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml_ file on the classpath.

IMPORTANT: This quickstart can run in 2 modes: standalone on your machine and on Kubernetes / OpenShift Cluster. Quickstart requires Java 8 or Java 11 (`fuse-java-openshift-jdk11-rhel8` image is used to build in Java 11).

== Deployment options

You can run this quickstart in the following modes:

* Kubernetes / Single-node OpenShift cluster
* Standalone on your machine

The most effective way to run this quickstart is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

For more details about running this quickstart on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

== Running the Quickstart on a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster

IMPORTANT: You need to run this example on Container Development Kit 3.3 or OpenShift 3.7.
Both of these products have suitable Fuse images pre-installed.
If you run it in an environment where those images are not preinstalled follow the steps described in <<single-node-without-preinstalled-images>>.

A single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your quickstart there.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the quickstart:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted quickstart application (for example, `my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-amq`) :
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-amq
----

. Before running the quickstart, you need to configure AMQ Broker (to create user and queue - both as an admin). Run the following commands to apply configuration files:

+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
$ oc apply -f src/main/resources/k8s
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `spring-boot-camel-amq` has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, navigate to the details page deployment of the `spring-boot-camel-amq` application: `https://OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR:8443/console/project/MY_PROJECT_NAME/browse/rc/spring-boot-camel-amq-NUMBER_OF_DEPLOYMENT?tab=details`.

. Switch to tab `Logs` and then see the messages sent by Camel.

== Running the quickstart standalone on your machine

To run this quickstart as a standalone project on your local machine:

. You need to have a running instance of AMQ Broker with messaging user `user1:test` and queue `incomingOrders`.
+
You can use AMQ Broker instance from previous steps. You need to configure the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file in order to
use the correct remote instance of AMQ Broker.
+
Get remote url of AMQ Broker instance by running the following command:

+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get addressspace spring-boot-camel-amq -o jsonpath={.status.endpointStatuses[?(@.name==\'messaging\')].externalHost}
----
+
Fill this value into `src/main/resources/application.properties` instead of `FILL_ME`.

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.
. Build the project:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean package
----
. Run the service:

+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
. See the messages sent by Camel.
